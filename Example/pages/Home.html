		Two countries are posted here. Those are places which the writer wanted to visit someday. <br>
Why these countries in particular? The writer have no idea either.  Probably because of their, constant, cold weather.  <br> And, no, the writer was not paid by their tourism board.  So, please, enjoy the writer's mildly interesting ramblings.
